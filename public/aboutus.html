                <p class="mx-5 ">Youth Empowerment Platform (YEP) is a youth-orientated non-governmental organization,
                    located in Gostivar.
                    <br><br>
                    It was founded on April 24, 2015 by a group of enthusiastic young people who believe in amplifying
                    the voices of young people and serving their communities.
                    <br><br>
                    YEP strives to support Gostivar’s youth by fostering their leadership skills, encouraging their
                    civic engagement, providing technical skills, and ensuring all members have a space to full their
                    potential in becoming their most authentic, best version of themselves.</p>

                    <p class="my-6 font-semibold">YEP has been active for four years, and during this time, more than 50
                        activists
                        have supported the mission and goals.
                        Currently, there are nine different projects our members participate in or lead. These projects
                        include the following: Say It, TechUp, Film It, YEP Talks, My Future, Techathon, Gostronic, and
                        My City, My Pride.
                        Through these projects, YEP has supported over 600 young people by assisting them with obtaining
                        various technical skills, providing mentorship, and fostering their activism.
                        In addition to the regularly scheduled projects, YEP holds informal activities — like movie
                        nights or group hikes — for the members. During the academic year 2018-2019, approximately 200
                        people from Gostivar have attended these events.
                        Not only are these events a way for members to develop their skills and knowledge, but they also
                        serve as a networking event.</p>

                            YEP’s active members consist of more than 30 youth, mainly between the ages of 14 and 19.
                            There
                            are
                            also some more experienced members, between the ages of 20 and 29.<br>
                            Our members are passionate
                            about
                            serving their communities, learning from each other, and building their experiences. While
                            the
                            president is available to guide and mentor YEP members, it’s the members who take the lead
                            on
                            projects.<br>
                            Members meet once a week to discuss the projects they’d like to design and implement,
                            and
                            the president is there to facilitate the meetings and provide any support they may need. The
                            task of
                            the president is to act as a moderator during the meeting, and never as a lawgiver. This
                            ensures
                            that the members are actively involved during the discussions at the meetings.
